        <h1>MY STORY</h1>
          <p>Hey there, Iâ€™m Jennifer! Born and raised right here in Jacksonville, Florida. 
              I have lived here all of my life and have always had a furry friend in my home from back when I was a little girl to gifting the love of animals to my own little girls. Outside of having pets big and small, furry and scaly, I also worked x years in a veterinary office and gained valuable knowlegde in more advanced care options for pets of many species. 
          </p>
          <p>   
              On a more personal level, I am married to a courageous police officer and we have 5 amazing kids ages 19-27. We come from families that valued hard work ethic and southern hospitality. Outside of working, we enjoy camping, traveling and loads of family time. 
          </p>
          <p>
              I look forward for the chance to meet your furry, winged, or scaly friend!  
          </p>
