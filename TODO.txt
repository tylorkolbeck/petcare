- Do you offer a consultation prior to booking pet care? Yes. I prefer to meet you and your pet, prior to leaving them in my care. This helps with removing the "surprise" element your pet may experience. Having a little meet and greet also allows us to go over the routine and care of your pet, as well as, addressing any questions, reviewing paperwork and payment options.
